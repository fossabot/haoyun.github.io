title: Trying to make slides in HTML

I spent some days on making some slides using `bespoke.js`.

Here you can see the [demo][demo] with [source][source] written in markdown and
converted to HTML by Pandoc.

Some parts of the texts are generated by mathgen. I am still working on it.
There are many to be done.

[demo]: /files/bespoke-test/dist/
[source]: /files/bespoke-test/src/index.txt

There are some reasons that I choose `bespoke.js`:

- There are 5 formats that are supported by `Pandoc`
   * `slidy`, `slideous` and `s5` are not HTML5.
   * `dzslides` is too simple.
   * `reveal.js` is very hard to style --- it was my first choice but
     after tying to style it, i find it too difficult. The HTML that it
     produces are too heavily styled. One thing I like it is there are
     quite a lot of plugins.
- `impress.js` is tooooooo fancy for academic slides.
- `remark.js` is another nice option. However it has less features while 
  large file size than `bespoke.js`.
- `bespoke.js` has a micro file size, but provie tons of functions via
  plugins. It is very easy to style the slides: the default is `flexbox`.
  And there are more advantages.
